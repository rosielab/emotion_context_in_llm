    <h4>Notable Observation: <h5>This image shows that when "medication on the side" was removed from
      the full caption, the predicted emotion changed from Physical Pain/Suffering
      to Disapproval. This is because the lack of description about environment in the image cap-
      tions seemed to impact Physical Pain/Suffering the most. The
      F1 score dropped from 0.73 with full captions to 0.46 and it is
      even lower than the F1 score for captions without interactions.
      As a result, we observed that Physical Pain/Suffering needed
      both the interaction and environment descriptions to be well
      recognized by GPT-3.5</h5></h4>
